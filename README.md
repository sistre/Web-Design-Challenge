Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard

This repository contains the code for a visualization dashboard with the following pages:

### A landing page containing:
An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

### Four visualization pages, each with:
A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

### A "Comparisons" page that:
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

### A "Data" page that:
Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
Also included is a Jupyter Notebook that was initially used used to produce the data table.

A live page can be found at the following site:
